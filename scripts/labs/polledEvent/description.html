PolledEvent keeps the CPU cool by firing events only at regular intervals. For example, instead of firing the scroll event at each tick, it will fire it only once every 200 milliseconds (if the page was actually scrolled of course). It is an abstract plugin able to do this for any event, however, for convenience, two extensions are bundled with it: mouse position and page scroll.
